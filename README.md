My Portfolio Website that was built using React. 

This was my first time using and learning the React Framework so the website does not feature much advanced functionality. 
What I learnt was about React Components and how they are implemented. 
They are smaller independent parts of a whole website/codebase. Each component returns HTML via a render() function that makes up one part of the website. 
These components have seperate and independent code from one another and are very similar to classes from OOP. 
This also makes them reusable as well but most of my components were one use only.
For this website I had the following components:
Introduction, Skills, Timeline, Sidebar.

Here's what I could learn next about React:
Using how to learn Props to pass data from 1 component to another and using States to store data and use them in functions or pass them along as well using Props.
